                        from
                        JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of
                        arbitration,
                        your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other
                        witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction
                        without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your

                    . You acknowledge that certain
                    Payees may not accept payment from all types of funding sources and that we may otherwise
                    limit the payment methods available for a particular Payee. Additionally, Safehold may, at
                    its discretion, impose limits on the number and amount of payments, in aggregate, that you
                    can send using the Payment Services. Safehold. may refuse to permit payment to any Payee if
                    we reasonably believe such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons.
                    If you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Funding Account that is insufficient to
                    fund any payment that you initiate, Safehold. may refuse to make any subsequent payment for
                    as long as we determine to be necessary or appropriate. Safehold also reserves the right to
                    refuse to make any payment.

                    <br />
                    Safehold. reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf,
                    and the method to return funds to you in the event your Funding Account is closed or
                    otherwise unavailable to us. The payment methods through the Payment Services may include,
                    but are not limited to, electronic or paper check payments, your designated credit card, or
                    payment via other form of funds transfer that Safehold. may choose to employ. Payments to
                    Payees outside of the United States, including its territories, are prohibited through the
                    Payment Services. The Payment Services does not support payment to all types of government
                    agencies.

                    . When you send a payment via the Payment
                    Services, the Payee is not required to accept it. You also understand that Payees, payment
                    processors, or the mail/package delivery service providers may return payments to the
                    Payment Services for various reasons. These reasons can include, but are not limited to: the
                    Payee’s forwarding address has expired; the Payee’s account number is not valid; the Payee
                    is unable to locate the account; or your account with the Payee is paid in full. You agree
                    that you will not hold Safeholdliable for any damages resulting from a Payee not receiving
                    payment made through the Payment Services for any reason.We use reasonable efforts to
                    research and correct the returned payment and deliver it to your Payee. Payments outstanding
                    after a reasonable time based on the method of payment may be automatically voided by
                    Safehold and the payment amount credited to your Funding Account. You are responsible for
                    reconciling your Account(s) and reviewing the status of the payments. If we are unable to
                    complete a payment for any reason, we may, in a method of our choosing and at our sole
                    discretion, provide you with notice. We will, to the extent permitted by law, make
                    reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited or denied
                    payments to your Funding Account, or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to
                    you as permitted by law.

                    . Account In using the Payment Services,
                    you are requesting Safehold to facilitate making payments from your Funding Account(s) to
                    your Payee(s). If Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding
                    Account to complete a payment transaction you request for any reason (for example,
                    non-sufficient funds, closed account, inability to locate account, or reversal by you and/or
                    your bank), the transaction may not be completed. If Payment Service is unable to access
                    funds from your specified Funding Account for any reason, you agree that: you will reimburse
                    Safehold immediately, upon demand, the transaction amount to the extent that Safehold sent a
                    payment to the Payee on your behalf; you will reimburse Safehold for any fees imposed on us
                    as a result of the transaction; if during the telephone call you make when you initiate
                    payment for the Payment Services you agree that Safehold. can rely on your verbal
                    authorization for the payment method you select; you agree to give Safehold permission to
                    record the call should any dispute arise regarding the Service; and you will reimburse the
                    Payment Services for any fees, including reasonable attorney fees, we incur in attempting to
                    collect the amount of the transaction from you
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Additionally, you agree that Safehold. may: (a) reverse any corresponding credit or direct
                    deposits issued to you; (b) reverse any payments Safehold made to your Payee; (c) apply any
                    money currently held by Safehold to any amount owed to us; and (d) initiate electronic fund
                    transfer from your account to collect any unpaid amounts and our fees. Safehold is not
                    responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges
                    (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to
                    maintain a balance or available credit in the Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all
                    payments you initiate. If Safehold is not able to recover all amounts owed to us, we may
                    report this information to third parties, including consumer reporting agencies and
                    financial institutions. Safeholdreserves all rights to pursue all available legal remedies
                    to recover allowed amounts.

                    Services, including the following: you direct Safehold to submit a payment to a Payee from
                    the wrong Funding Account; you erroneously direct Safehold to submit a payment to a Payee
                    multiple times; you direct Safehold to submit the wrong amount to a Payee; you direct
                    Safehold to submit a payment to the wrong Payee; or you change your mind about making a
                    payment to a Payee after directing Safehold to submit the payment. You are responsible for
                    all fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by Safehold, a Payee, you or a
                    third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement and/or your use of the
                    Payment Services. You agree to reimburse Safehold, a Payee or the applicable third party for
                    any and all such liability.In the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to Safehold
                    for a payment you authorized through the Payment Services, Safehold may immediately remove
                    such amounts from or charge such amounts to your applicable Funding Account. If the
                    applicable Funding Account does not have funds or available credit sufficient to cover your
                    liability, you will be required to immediately add funds to the Funding Account or otherwise
                    provide payment to Safehold through other means. If you do not do so, Safehold may engage in
                    collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.Safehold does not have control of, or
                    liability for, the items that are paid for via the Payment Services.

                    . Our ability to stop a payment request will depend on the
                    manner in which the payment was initiated, the method of payment, and whether or not the
                    Payee has begun processing payment. Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate
                    a stop payment request, we will have no liability for failing to do so unless there is an
                    exception provided elsewhere in this Agreement. We may also require you to present your stop
                    payment request in writing after contacting customer care. The charge for each stop payment
                    will be the current charge for such stop payment and fund recovery service as set out in any
                    applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through the site.

                        posting payments by Payees or financial institutions or errors with account
                        information or funding instructions.When you send a payment to certain Payees, the
                        payment may be treated as an authorization to the Payee to process your payment and
                        complete the transaction. Some Payees may delay processing your payment, in which
                        case the payment may be held as pending until the Payee processes your payment and
                        your payment authorization will remain valid for up to 30 days.To help ensure that

                        through the Payment Services, you should submit payment instructions prior to the
